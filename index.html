                <p>Javascript is a scripting language which is known to add behaviour to website pages. It is cross-platform, light-weight language used by users to create dynamic webpages. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                    Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Initially, javascript was developed to serve the purpose on clinet side only but now it has been extended to use on server side
                    also. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client Side Javascript - It extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond
                        to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation</li>
                    <li>Server Side Javascript - It extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
                        from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>In any online IDE, you can write <code>console.log("Hello World")</code>. Now press ctrl+shift+I to open console window and see the output there.</li>

                <p>Variable is anything that can change any time. In javascript, variables are a container for the data that can change later on. It is known by another name called identifier. There are certain rules which are to be followed while declaring
                    an identifier. It cannot start with number. Subsequent characters can be letters, numbers or underscores. You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters
                    in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
